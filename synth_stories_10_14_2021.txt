This is an example of how you can use a storyboard to tell a story.
You have three different scenes that are related by time, space or action.
In each scene there is only one main character.
Each scene has a title and some description of the setting.
Now take your storyboard and write out all the details about the characters and their actions.
When you finish writing them down make sure that every detail is included.
If you don't include something people won't be able to understand what happened.
After you've written everything down draw a picture of each scene.
