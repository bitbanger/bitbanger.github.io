<p style="font-weight: bold;">How to Raymond Carve a Turkey</p>
Ingredients:
<br />
<br />
Have the knife in my hand. Had this bird splayed on the board practically since lunch, too. Jen sitting there on those hard oak dining chairs we got. Flesh on wood just the same.
<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align: left;">
Steps:
<br />
<br />
Have the knife in my hand but can't make the cut.
<br />
<br />
"Are we eating or not," goes Jen.
<br />
<br />
"We're eating," I go.
<br />
<br />
I choke back some spit, make a lateral slice when she isn't looking, but the piece ends up all lopsided. I sweep it into the trash.
<br />
<br />
"What was that," goes Jen. She looks up at me, then toward the wastebin. She lingers there.
<br />
<br />
In this, too, she was right.

<div style="text-align: right; background-color: #f9f4f0; background-image: url('images/natural_paper.png'); width: 35%; border-radius: 2px; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23); margin: 20px auto; padding: 20px;">
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Bananas Foster Wallace</p>
Ingredients:
<br />
<br />
Getting to and through the store at this time of day, because of course it's the time of day when everyone with a standard U.S. nine-to-five is hoping to cop some food just like you, is pretty hard, so after maybe 30 minutes of just basically still-motion-yet-somehow-onward driving that would make Leibniz smile, you're still going to have to wade through probably 30 more of some soul-killing Muzak and/or corporate pop to even get to the bananas, which (the bananas) are notably *not* in the store's right-up-front "convenience plaza" [1], from which plaza you'll want to grab sugar and butter by the way, and you can cop some rum at the adjacent liquor store on your way out, or in Southie on your drive home, since you'll be there anyway if that's your bag.
<br />
<br />
<p style="text-align: left;">
Steps:
<br />
<br />
1. Melt the butter [2] and wait and let the resultant, Parkinsonially tremulous pool of lipids signal you to add the bananas.
<br />
<br />
2. Add the bananas.
<br />
<br />
3. And but so then after the application of tremendous Maillardian patience, you'll have browned them--"caramelized", of course, being the more common and far less semiotically ambiguous synonym--and so you've browned them and can get to what obv. you wanted to get to if you're making b.fos. in the first place.
<br />
<br />
4. The novelty of igniting bananas in rum is undeniable, of course, but pretty deep down you know you're not going to make a really distinctive dish just by lighting it on fire--and you won't kid yourself here, either: there's a reason you're making them on the exact night your roommate's girlfriend is over (bananas foster qua bananas foster doesn't really excite you regardless), and there's a reason you have to engage in an internal psychic war with yourself every night she's over anyway, and those are probably the same reason, and somehow you feel that reason isn't even good old fashioned jealousy but rather something that's just all you and always will be--because you could probably just broil them or grill them or something and never know the difference, but so anyway you'll douse them in rum and set them ablaze [3].
<br />
<br />
V. By step V, here, which is honestly kind of a meta-step and thus marked as V instead of 5, yrs trly feels it's important to remind you that it's likely not too late, if you got your rum at the liquor store, to head to Southie after all and cop what you really want if you need to, which you promised yourself you wouldn't this week but it's good to be aware of your options, y.t. thinks, anyway.
<br />
<br />
[1] Which is only arguably even any more convenient, given its exit-proximity and horizontal anti-optimization, than the sundry-laden alternative.
<br />
<br />
[2] This step will likely take the longest in an American kitchen given the remarkably U.S. tendency [a] to refrigerate butter.
<br />
[a] (like so many other U.S. tendencies toward organic preservation)
<br />
<br />
[3] Never mind the obvious interpretation, here, which interpretation y.t. is probably just considering leveraging for a more compelling piece of culinary journalism anyway.
