A lot of you probably recall that I just got my driver's license recently. Since I've been on the road, I've picked up a few tips that you might like to refresh yourself on:
<br />
<br />
1. Most US states mandate that you give at least three feet of distance to cyclists, but the axes aren't specified; a sweet jump that clears their helmet by three feet is perfectly acceptable.
<br />
<br />
2. Drivers of large trucks often have "bald spots" on the backs, sides, and fronts of their heads. For your own safety, try to refrain from getting too close to them.
<br />
<br />
3. If you come up to a traffic light that's been red for some time, consider it a "stale red" and floor the accelerator as a precaution.
<br />
<br />
4. If you have the right of way but are still hit by someone who's disobeying the law, the paramedics legally have to try extra hard to save you.
<br />
<br />
5. You're generally allowed to turn left on a red light from a one way street onto another one way street, however, this is probably an indication that you're lost.
